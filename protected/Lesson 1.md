    - 3-2-1 Activity
        - Three facts from the video
        - Two facts you never knew
        - One question you have after watching the video


### Preparation Notes
- For the video and the article, we will complete a 3-2-1 reflection. Make sure to create an online or offline discussion board that allows students to see their classmate’s 3-2-1 responses. Here is an example of an online discussion board, Padlet. Create a free Padlet account or use another tool if you prefer.
- Create Conversation Agreements for your class
    - When talking about identity, there can sometimes be a high degree of vulnerability that students will bring to the conversation. It is important to try as best we can to create a space that supports and celebrates personal vulnerability. To that end, it might be helpful to create some conversation agreements with the class before breaking into groups. These agreements are simple ground rules for how to interact with each other.
    - If you already have a classroom contract, or classroom agreements in your room, it might be sufficient to simply remind students of the classroom contract in this activity. If you do not, here are a few recommended agreements for the conversation:
        - _Care for each other_. It takes a lot to share details about yourself, and we should all care for and support each other in sharing our identities.
        - _Listen to each other_. People feel supported when you show you’re listening, whether that’s by saying you identify with information someone else shared, or repeating back something you heard in someone else’s Daisy that you found interesting.
        - _It’s okay to feel uncomfortable_. If you are feeling uncomfortable about something someone said, or some part of the activity, let your group know or let your teacher know.

The video clip is approximately 4 minutes and 13 seconds. Here is the <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vRueNubPpEbUuhQe-3HMsFl4CbFpVRUL81uLOA0PBQg/edit?usp=drive_link">script</a> and the <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q3fgnGb5MpsJXptjGBQM-n0B6poMQONYaXBZk_dsP7c/edit?usp=sharing">slides (Slides 1 - 6)</a> used in the video.
    - Pause the video for a 5 minute conversation on community norms with the entire class(10 minutes)
    - Add to Discord community norms that students want to add
5. At the 5 minute and 46 second mark, pause the video and give students 3 minutes to think about different examples of data activism and record their answers. 
    - Have students share their answers with the whole class for 3 minutes
6. Play the video titled  “Intro to Data Activism”.  The video clip is from 5 minutes and 46 seconds- 7 minutes and 20 second mark
7. At the 7 minutes and 20 second mark, pause the video and play the  “AI, Ain’t I A Woman”(3 minutes) video. Click on the  “AI, Ain’t I A Woman”.
    - While they are watching the video, have students take notes using the 3,2,1 framework (Give students 5 minutes)
    - After the video is over, instruct students to complete their 3,2,1
    - Once everyone completes the discussion board, everyone should discuss their answers in their small group of 10 people for 5 minutes, then in the larger group of 20 students for 5 minutes
    - Here are the main points of the video and how it relates to combining art with data visualizations to evoke empathy for minoritized communities. Ensure students discuss the following topics:
    - Art, such as spoken word poetry can be a way to share data activism
    - Bias in AI Systems: The video demonstrates how AI systems, specifically facial recognition           technologies, can exhibit significant biases against women and people of color. This                 highlights the critical issue of biased training data and the subsequent impact on AI's              accuracy and fairness.
    - Historical Context of Bias: The title references Sojourner Truth's famous speech, "Ain't I A         Woman?", drawing a parallel between historical and contemporary struggles against racial and         gender discrimination. This context underscores the persistence of bias across different eras        and technologies.
    - Impact on Marginalized Communities: The biases in AI technologies can lead to real-world             consequences for marginalized communities. These biases can perpetuate discrimination and            inequality, affecting everything from hiring practices to law enforcement.
    - Accountability and Ethics in AI: The video calls for greater accountability and ethical              considerations in the development and deployment of AI technologies. It stresses the         
      importance of developers, companies, and policymakers being aware of and addressing potential        biases in their systems.
    - Role of Advocacy and Awareness: The video itself is a form of advocacy, raising awareness            about the issues of bias in AI. It encourages viewers to think critically about the                  technologies they use and the broader societal impacts of these technologies.
8. Play the video titled  “Intro to Data Activism”.  The video clip is from  7 minutes and 23 seconds - 7 minutes and 57 seconds. Here is the <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ecd8sHNpMtp8PypXV5VPX6z0BhLkyK23YWsQN9lNtVQ/edit?tab=t.0">script</a>  and <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q3fgnGb5MpsJXptjGBQM-n0B6poMQONYaXBZk_dsP7c/edit?usp=sharing">slides (11-12)</a> for this section of the video.
9. At the 7 minute and 57 second mark, pause the video and play the “Ida B. Wells and the Long Crusade to Outlaw Lynching | Retro Report” video(10 minutes). 
10. After the video is over, instruct students to complete their 3,2,1.
     - Once everyone completes the discussion board, everyone should discuss their answers in their         small group of 10 people for 5 minutes, then in the larger group of 20 students for 5 minutes
     - Students should discuss all of the following topics: In summary, Ida B. Wells' investigative         work exemplifies the power of data activism. By meticulously gathering and analyzing data on         lynching, she was able to expose injustices, shift public opinion, and advocate for legal            reforms, demonstrating the enduring impact of data-driven activism in the fight for social           justice.
     - <a href = "https://retroreport.org/transcript/ida-b-wells-and-the-long-crusade-to-outlaw-lynching/">The Retro Report</a>
         - <em>Data Collection and Analysis</em>:Wells' meticulous collection of data on lynching               incidents can be seen as an early form of data activism. She gathered, analyzed, and                 published detailed accounts and statistics to expose the systemic nature of racial                   violence​
         - <em>Use of Data to Drive Social Change</em>: By publishing her findings in pamphlets and             newspapers, Wells used data to inform and mobilize the public against lynching. Her work             demonstrated how data could be leveraged to drive social change and hold authorities                 accountable​ 
         - <em>Challenging Official Narratives</em>: Wells' data activism challenged the prevailing             narratives that justified lynching as a response to crimes. Her investigations revealed              that many lynching victims were innocent, thus undermining the rationale used to                     perpetuate such violence.
         - <em>Building a Case for Legal Reforms</em>: The data Wells collected helped build a                  compelling case for making lynching a federal crime. Although federal anti-lynching                  legislation was not enacted until 2022, her work laid the foundation for these efforts               and showcased the importance of data in advocating for legal reforms.

    - Discuss this question as a large group with 20 people (5 minutes): “How has your understanding of data activism changed?" 
    - Discuss this question as a large group with 20 people:  "What’s the importance of using data to advocate for oppressed groups?
        - Answer to look for: Using data to advocate for oppressed groups is crucial because it provides credibility and objectivity, highlighting systemic issues and patterns of discrimination that might otherwise be overlooked. Data raises public awareness and mobilizes support by making complex issues more accessible through visualizations and statistics. It informs policy and legal reforms by guiding decision-making processes and holds institutions accountable by tracking progress and ensuring transparency. Additionally, data empowers communities by equipping them with the necessary information to advocate for their rights and mobilize for collective action.
