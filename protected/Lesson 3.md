5. Play the video titled, “Pa'lante Restorative Justice: Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR)”(6 minutes) , which discusses a prime example of how high school students are using YPAR, another form of CPAR, to make their school more inclusive
6. Instruct students to reflect on what they learned from the video, then collaborate as a whole class to arrange the steps of CPAR in the correct ordeR (5 minutes). The teacher should facilitate by asking students which steps go in which order. The teacher will place the steps based on the students' input.
