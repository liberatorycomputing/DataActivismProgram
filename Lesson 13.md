### Activity Steps

1. Play a video titled, “Research Methods” along with the script. Here is an overview of what is discussed in the script
    - Explain to students that they will learn about different research methods. All of these methods have their pros and cons.  Most CPAR projects use at least 2 methods at some point in order to get the information they need to make a change.
    - As researchers, our job is to ask questions and find answers. But before we can start, we need to think about the big questions we want to answer. We can use our goals to help us come up with these questions.
    - Give a brief description of each research method:
        - **Surveys:** Surveys ask specific questions and tend to include short answer, multiple-choice, and scaled-answer questions. Surveys can be done online, through the mail, and can be written and filled out in person. The most effective way to conduct surveys in support of organizing is in an in person “interview style” so that the surveyor can make personal connections with the respondent.
        - **Interviews:**  Interviews are guided conversations about a specific topic, are often done one-on-one, and tend to use open-ended questions in order to get in-depth explanations. 
        - **Focus Groups:** Are small group sessions (7-12 people) that are led by a facilitator in order to obtain opinions based on the research question. 
        - **Secondary Data:**  Is data that comes from someone else’s research. This is distinct from “primary data” which is original data that you collect through your own research in the field.
        - **Literature Review:** This is a review of existing articles, academic studies or reports in order to find out what information already exists about the topic you are exploring
2. Students will try the aforementioned research methods at different stations. Each group will be at each station for no more than 5 minutes.  Make sure the groups understand that this is to get an idea of what this method is like — it is NOT a training in how to use this method.  Each group should fill out a worksheet about the pros and cons of each method.  Once all are done, as a large group collect all information on a large flip chart. The stations are:
    - Station 1: <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/17sH90eRi5IQZnLgJuIOCBOXYe2Oogx8I/view?usp=drive_link">surveys</a>
    - Station 2: <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1irrgUFpKicviXZcpWnytZcPWyM_MJ5wm/view?usp=drive_link">photovoice</a>/art-based
    - Station 3: <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wkLcbfCshK0a_h5gvCuWsbfV-Q03SpC-/edit%23heading=h.3lyw376lyurk">interviews</a>
    - Station 4: <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wkLcbfCshK0a_h5gvCuWsbfV-Q03SpC-/edit%23heading=h.pea57f6zd67b">focus groups</a>
    - Station 5: <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wkLcbfCshK0a_h5gvCuWsbfV-Q03SpC-/edit%23heading=h.lskyigfwai8w">journal entries</a>
    - Station 6: <a href = "https://news.yale.edu/2020/01/30/national-survey-students-feelings-about-high-school-are-mostly-negative">Data Analysis</a> and <a href = "https://news.yale.edu/2020/01/30/national-survey-students-feelings-about-high-school-are-mostly-negative">Literature Review</a>
**Review pros and cons of each method at the end of EACH session. Here is the <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cKKABjhhU8nptMDd8FEo2087nNXJRRqM/view?usp=drive_link">answer key</a>**

3. **Reflect:** After all groups have gone to all stations, talk about the different methods.  Ask the participants for general feedback:
    - Which method did you like the best?  The least?
    - What kind of information do you get from the different methods?
    - What is the value of each method?
    - What resources would we need for each method?
    - How much time would we need to use each method?
